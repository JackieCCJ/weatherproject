# weatherproject
I am thinking of changing the name of this project to: Skip the Rains  (xD)

With a description: Enjoy the outdoors (If this would be uploaded as an app one day)

This will be my first project on a full-stack track. 
Let's begin with implement Weather APIs and automating the response for the input destination and give feedback on whether it's a bad or good weather.

Added .env file which is hidden from the Github containing my own weather API key

Link to explaining the response format:[OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/current#format)
